Code scans TCP ports and returns information on if they are open or closed. 

UPDATES:
Updated PortScanner to take a value to scan to (inputing a value of 20 would scan ports 1-20). 
Updated tests to work with the added functionality
    Added a testVar variable to test to allow easy testing of different variables
    Attepmpted to address issues with port 80 not opening by changing expected value of openPorts to 1 if 
        input was greater than or equal to 22. 
Also added testVar variable to main for ease of testing.
